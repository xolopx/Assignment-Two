/**
 * Created by tom on 23/04/2018.
 * This class extends MyPolygons and adds the functionality to sort a MyPolygons list.
 * "extends" = "inherits"
 * SortedPolygons has all of the functionality of MyPolygons plus some more that I am going to add.
 * This class is the same as MyPolygons however it has additional functionality.
